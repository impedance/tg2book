# Current State of the Project

## Changes Made:
- Added logging to check the HTML content being added to the EPUB file.
- Ensured the cover image is only added once.

## Next Steps:
- Run the bot to test the logging and ensure the HTML content is being logged correctly.
- Verify that the EPUB file is generated correctly with the cover image and images included in the chapter.
- Test the bot to ensure it handles links and forwarded messages as expected and sends the EPUB file correctly.
