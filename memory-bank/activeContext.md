# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on improving code quality for the bot:

1. **Core Functionality**: Focus on the main functionality of the bot
   - Building robust message handling
   - Improving EPUB generation
   - Enhancing user experience
   
2. **Future Tasks**:
   - Refactor code to improve maintainability
   - Add new features
   - Fix any issues discovered during development

## Recent Changes

- Created test_bot.py with unit tests
- Set up pytest fixtures for simulating different message types
- Implemented mocking for external dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Improve error handling in message processing
2. Refactor code for better maintainability
3. Implement new features
4. Enhance user experience with better feedback

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose to handle forwarded messages by extracting text and images directly.
- Used the `forwarded_from_message` attribute to access the content of the forwarded message.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Forwarded messages can be accessed using `forwarded_from_message` or `forwarded_from_chat`.
- Extracting images from forwarded messages requires handling the `photo` attribute.
