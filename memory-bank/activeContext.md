# Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on improving code quality for the bot:

1. **Core Functionality**: Focus on the main functionality of the bot
   - Building robust forwarded message handling
   - Improving EPUB generation
   - Enhancing user experience
   
2. **Future Tasks**:
   - Add media handling capabilities (images)
   - Refactor code to improve maintainability
   - Fix any issues discovered during development

## Recent Changes

- Created test_bot.py with unit tests
- Set up pytest fixtures for simulating different message types
- Implemented mocking for external dependencies

## Next Steps

- Implement Dropbox integration (see memory-bank/dropbox_integration.md)

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose to handle forwarded messages by extracting content and metadata.
- Using `forward_origin` property to identify and process forwarded messages.
- Using temporary directories for file operations to ensure cleanup.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Different types of forwarded origins require specific handling (user, chat, hidden_user).
- EPUB generation requires proper HTML content structure.
- Proper cleanup of temporary files is important for long-running bots.
