# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Modified the bot to handle forwarded messages instead of links.
- Implemented changes in `bot.py` to parse forwarded messages and create EPUB files.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `handle_message` function to check for forwarded messages.
- Added logic to extract text and images from forwarded messages.
- Ensured images are downloaded and added to the EPUB file.

## Next Steps
- Test the bot with forwarded messages to ensure the new functionality works correctly.
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the completed task and any known issues.
- Consider adding error handling for edge cases (e.g., forwarded messages with no text or images).

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chose to handle forwarded messages by extracting text and images directly.
- Used the `forwarded_from_message` attribute to access the content of the forwarded message.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Forwarded messages can be accessed using `forwarded_from_message` or `forwarded_from_chat`.
- Extracting images from forwarded messages requires handling the `photo` attribute.
