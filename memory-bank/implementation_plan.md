# Implementation Plan

**1. Implement the Telegram Bot:**
   - Use the `python-telegram-bot` library to create a Telegram bot that listens for messages.
   - Implement the bot's message handling logic to receive and process user input, specifically forwarded Telegram posts.
   - Set up the bot's API token and configure it to run.

**2. Implement the EPUB Generator:**
   - Use the `ebooklib` library to generate the EPUB file from the raw text content.
   - Create the EPUB's metadata, including title, author, and publication date.
   - Add the raw text content to the EPUB file.
   - Generate the final EPUB file in memory.

**3. Implement Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Add error handling to all modules to catch and handle potential exceptions.
   - Implement logging to track the bot's activity and errors.

**4. Implement Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for each module to ensure its functionality.
   - Perform integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules.
   - Manually test the bot with different types of Telegram posts.
