# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic bot functionality is implemented and working.
*   Core commands (start, help) are functional.
*   Forwarded message handling is implemented.
*   EPUB generation from forwarded messages works.
*   Basic test suite with pytest is in place.

## What's Left to Build

*   Enhanced formatting options.
*   Media content handling (images).
*   Book metadata customization.
*   Better error handling with detailed messages.

## Current Status

The project has a working implementation with basic functionality. The bot can process forwarded messages and generate EPUB files.

## Known Issues

*   No support for media content yet.
*   Limited formatting options in the generated EPUB.
*   Empty first page in EPUB output (title page separated from content)
*   No metadata customization for the EPUB files.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Using Python for backend development due to its extensive libraries.
*   Using `python-telegram-bot` for Telegram API integration.
*   Using `ebooklib` for EPUB file generation.
*   Using temporary directories for file operations to ensure proper cleanup.

## 2024-06-18 - Initial Implementation

- Implemented core functionality:
  - Start command
  - Help command
  - EPUB creation from forwarded messages
  - Handling different types of forwarded origins (user, chat, hidden_user)
  - Basic error handling
- Used python-telegram-bot for Telegram API integration
- Used ebooklib for EPUB file generation
- Set up test infrastructure with pytest

## 2025-05-14 - EPUB Structure Optimization

### Implemented
- Added analysis phase for EPUB structure:
  - Verified EpubHtml parameters
  - Audited spine/navigation structure
- Prepared refactoring plan:
  - Content unification strategy
  - HTML cleanup requirements

### Next Steps
1. Code modifications:
   - Merge title and content in create_epub method (lines 47-54)
   - Remove duplicate HTML tags
   - Adjust section metadata

2. Validation steps:
   - Generate test EPUB files
   - Verify in Calibre, Apple Books, FBReader
   - Run epubcheck 4.2.6 validation

3. Additional improvements:
   - CSS normalization
   - Whitespace optimization in generated HTML

### Status
- Planning phase completed
- Ready for implementation in Act Mode
