# Progress

## What Works

*   Basic bot functionality is implemented and working.
*   Core commands (start, help) are functional.
*   Forwarded message handling is implemented.
*   EPUB generation from forwarded messages works.
*   Basic test suite with pytest is in place.

## What's Left to Build

*   Enhanced formatting options.
*   Media content handling (images).
*   Book metadata customization.
*   Better error handling with detailed messages.

## Current Status

The project has a working implementation with basic functionality. The bot can process forwarded messages and generate EPUB files.

## Known Issues

*   No support for media content yet.
*   Limited formatting options in the generated EPUB.
*   No metadata customization for the EPUB files.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Using Python for backend development due to its extensive libraries.
*   Using `python-telegram-bot` for Telegram API integration.
*   Using `ebooklib` for EPUB file generation.
*   Using temporary directories for file operations to ensure proper cleanup.
